## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
- [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my second project using reactJs. I used this project to learn more react and give tailwindcss a try. This was my first attempt at tailwind
and it took a while to get used to but toward the end of my project I started to see its advantages to quickly style my project. However, I dislike
having such long classes in my html, which caused a little confusion once the project started getting a little larger. I ended up learning a little more
react, specifically the useContext hook which made the cart functionality a bit easier to use instead of passing the cart though so many components.

### Continued development

I plan to continue development on this projects shopping cart functionality, currently the shopping cart only accepts the one object. I would like to add a few more
products to acutally simulate a real shopping cart experience.
